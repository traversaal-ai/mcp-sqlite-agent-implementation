# MCP SQL Agent 

This project demonstrates a simple client-server implementation using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is a standardized way to connect large language models with tools and data, specifically for managing and interacting with an SQLite database.

## Overview

This example shows how to:
- Create an MCP server with custom tools to interact with an SQLite database.
- Connect to the server using an MCP client.
- Call tools to generate SQL queries, create database tables, and retrieve data.
- Use OpenAI (or Azure OpenAI) to dynamically generate SQL queries.

## Server Implementation

The server exposes two tools:
1. **`database_update_tool`**: Executes SQL commands such as creating tables in the SQLite database (`mcp_db.db`).
2. **`query_data`**: Executes SELECT queries to retrieve data from the SQLite database.

The server listens for requests from the client and interacts with the SQLite database accordingly.

## Client Implementation

The client connects to the server via stdio, initializes a session, and sends SQL commands based on user input. The client uses OpenAI (or Azure OpenAI) to generate SQL queries dynamically from natural language input.

### Key Features:
- **SQLite Integration**: The client communicates with the `mcp_db.db` SQLite database, performing operations like creating tables and querying data.
- **Dynamic SQL Generation**: OpenAI generates SQL queries based on user input.
- **MCP Protocol**: The client and server communicate using the MCP protocol to call tools and execute SQL commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `uv` (Python package manager)
- SQLite (included with Python, but ensure it's available)

### Installation



# Install dependencies
uv add "mcp[cli]" requests python-dotenv openai
or uv add -r requirements.txt


Running the Example
Start the client (which will automatically start the server):

uv run mcp_client.py


This command will:

Start the client, which connects to the MCP server.

The client will then send requests to the server to execute SQL queries.

Running the Server Manually
If you prefer, you can run the server separately with:

uv run mcp_server.py


Running the Client and Interacting with the Database
Once the client is running, it will:

Connect to the server.

Allow the user to input SQL-related commands (such as creating tables).

The client sends the input to OpenAI, which generates a corresponding SQL query.

The server executes the SQL query on the SQLite database and returns the result.

Example Use Case: Create a Table
For example, if the user types:


create table locations

The client will:

Ask OpenAI to generate a valid SQL query for creating the table.

The server will then execute the query in the mcp_db.db SQLite database.

Example Response

You: create table locations
[USING OpenAI] Generating SQL query from user input

Assistant: To create a table named `locations` in an SQLite database, you can use the following SQL statement. This example assumes you want to include some common fields such as `id`, `name`, and `address`, but you can modify it as needed to fit your use case.

```sql
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    latitude REAL,
    longitude REAL
);
```

This creates a table with the following columns:
- `id`: An integer that auto-increments with each new entry (serves as the primary key).
- `name`: A text field for the name of the location (not null).
- `address`: A text field for the address of the location (not null).
- `latitude`: A real number to store the latitude of the location.
- `longitude`: A real number to store the longitude of the location.

Feel free to adjust the column names and data types based on your specific requirements!
